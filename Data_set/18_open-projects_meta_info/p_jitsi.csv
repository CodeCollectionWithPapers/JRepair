Fix the failure by removing react-router.

This resulted in the JSON object with the final result getting a new message ID.  This commit fixed this issue by making a new ResponseObserver for each session  where each ResponseObserver has its own unique ID

While I tried to fix as many of them as possible  a portion of them actually go against our coding style. In such a case  I've disabled the indent rule which effectively leaves it as it was before ESLint 4.8.0.
